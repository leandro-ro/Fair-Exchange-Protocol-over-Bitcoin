	\chapter{Introduction}
        Bentov and Kumaresan state that a fair exchange protocol is a particular subcase of secure multiparty computation \cite{10.1007/978-3-662-44381-1_24}. Numerous multiparty computation protocols want to achieve a notion of security that is requiring a form of fairness. One common way of defining fairness, in this case, is \textit{if one party receives output, then so do all} \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-79263-5_8}. Cleve showed in \cite{10.1145/12130.12168} that it is impossible to achieve this notion of fairness when there is no honest majority among the protocol participants. Let us carry this knowledge into the context of a two-party exchange protocol: At the point where there is one dishonest party involved, it is impossible to achieve the mentioned form of fairness. Consequently, it is crucial to specify acceptable alternative notions of fairness that are specially tailored for the two-party case.
        
		\section{On Fairness}
		The obstacle when using the construct of \textit{fairness} is that various interpretations among different points of view exist. Markowitch et al. stated that it is crucial for defining fairness in exchange protocols to focus on what fairness is and not on how to obtain it \cite{10.1007/3-540-36552-4_31}. It is obvious to claim that a \textit{fair} exchange protocol requires that no party gains a \textit{significant advantage} over the other party under the limitation of particular assumptions. Different explanations of what is meant with a \textit{significant advantage} result in different fairness notions. \\
        The primary definition commonly used among publications around fair exchange protocols (like \cite{10.1145/266420.266426} \cite{asyncOptiFairEx1998} \cite{remarksOnFairEx2000})  is the following: \textit{At the end of every exchange protocol run, either all involved parties obtain their expected information/asset, or none of them receives anything.} This definition might be satisfying in some scenarios, but \textit{advantage} is defined minimally and only focuses on the actual exchange result here. In other words, this definition could be interpreted as some superficial notion of fairness. \\
        Let us imagine the following scenario: $B$, the buyer, and $M$, the merchant, use a fair exchange protocol $P$ to trade some digital coins for a digital item. The high-level procedure of $P$ is as follows: $B$ locks up digital coins that $B$ is willing to spend for a particular digital item $D$ that satisfies the predicate $\sigma$ s.t. $\sigma\left( D\right) =1$. The digital coins can be redeemed by $S$ if $S$ can deliver a digital item $D'$ s.t. $\sigma\left( D'\right) =1$. If $S$ can do this, $B$ can be sure that $D' = D$ and both parties are satisfied. If $S$ is not responding with a matching $D'$, the previously locked-up coins will be available for $B$ again after a pre-defined timeframe $t$, and $S$ cannot claim them anymore. \\
        In the sense of the above-defined superficial notion of fairness, this protocol is fair because there are only two possible outcomes of $P$. Either the exchange succeeded or non of the parties receives anything. 
        Although $P$ is certainly fair under this definition, $B$ got a significant disadvantage. $B$ cannot use the coins for something else during the execution of $P$, and a malicious $S$ could use this knowledge, e.g., for a DOS attack. One could argue that this is not fair because one party got a \textit{significant advantage} over the other party. Therefore giving definitions for different notions of fairness comes hand-in-hand with defining advantage. This is, unfortunately, missing in our mentioned superficial notion of fairness. 
        
        \subsubsection{Defining "Advantage"}
        While explaining \textit{advantage} in the context of fair exchange protocols \cite{10.1007/3-540-36552-4_31} comes up with three main aspects that make up different notions of fairness. (1) \textbf{Fairness}, directly relating to the items being exchanged during the protocol. (2) \textbf{Timeliness}, relating to determining the progress of a protocol and the option to abort it at some point while preserving fairness. (3) \textbf{Abuse-freeness}, in that sense, that no single party alone can prove to an outside one that he has the power to terminate or complete the protocol successfully. A specific notion of fairness might consider one aspect stronger, weaker, or even irrelevant. \\
        Projecting these aspects on our imaginary exchange protocol $P$: (1) is undoubtedly fulfilled because either the exchange succeeded or non of the parties receives anything. (2) is only partially fulfilled because $S$ might be able to abort by not responding, but $B$ must wait until the coins are unlocked. $B$ is also not able to determine the progress of the protocol. $S$ might be preparing the transmission of $D'$ or already aborted. Either way, the protocol is time-wise limited by the pre-defined timeframe $t$. (3) is not fulfilled. If $S$ indeed owns $D'$ s.t. $\sigma\left( D'\right) =1$, $S$ can prove to an outside party that $S$ has the power to terminate or complete $P$ successfully, at least inside the timeframe until $B$ can unlock the coins again. $S$ can abuse $P$ for the only purpose of blocking $B$'s coins for a particular time - even if $S$ does not know $D$.
        
        \subsubsection{Strong Fairness, Weak Fairness}
        Another common notion of fairness is \textit{Strong Fairness}, sometimes referred to as perfect fairness \cite{DELGADOSEGURA2020832}. Pagnia and Gaertner created an early formal definition for \textit{Strong Fairness} in exchange protocols \cite{Pagnia99onthe}. They are essentially stating that both parties got some expectation from the goods being exchanged, much like the predicate $\sigma$ of our imaginary protocol $P$. At the end of the protocol run, either both parties expectations are being fulfilled after the exchange protocol, or no information about the other party's respective good is gained. For a party participating in a protocol providing \textit{Strong Fairness}, there is no need to prove its honesty to a third party. Honesty is implicitly proven by following the protocol. \\
        A popular addition to this definition of \textit{Strong Fairness} today is the following: \textit{A single party cannot leave the protocol with even a small advantage over the opponent.} Again, this is not absolute and only valuable if \textit{advantage} is adequately defined, for example, by the three aspects mentioned. \\
        It is worth mentioning that some publications expect from their notion of \textit{Strong Fairness} that it should always be possible for the buyer to retrieve the original expected item in case of a problem, without needing the misbehaving party to cooperate. Usually, this is achieved by heavyweight Trusted Third Parties. However, there exist optimistic protocols using transparent Trusted Third Parties \cite{10.1145/3243734.3243857} \cite{6982058} that are used to maintain this notion of \textit{Strong Fairness}. \\
        While in \textit{Strong Fairness} usually, an honest party does not need to get active to prove its honesty, in \textit{Weak Fairness} an honest party can prove his honesty to an external judge, like a Trusted Third Party. The external judge can then evaluate the dispute. If the potentially misbehaving party is not cooperating, the honest party receives some compensation. A protocol achieving \textit{Weak Fairness} is therefore dependent on the external judge's honesty.
        
        \subsubsection{Probabilistic Fairness}
        Finally, there are Fair Exchange Protocols that merge their notion of fairness with probability. These are usually protocols that depend on techniques that offer a probability of fairness (e.g., cut-and-choose in \cite{DELGADOSEGURA2020832}) based on the chosen security parameters. This approach is challenging to classify in our existing idea of fairness. The most logical one is that we recognize \textit{Probabilistic Fairness} as a relativization to already defined notions of fairness since most definitions can be easily shifted into a probabilistic context. Although it is a straight forward answer, this raises the problem if notions like \textit{Perfect Fairness} can be seen in a probabilistic scenario, resulting in some form of \textit{Probabilistic Perfect Fairness}. Although this is a very relevant topic, we will leave this question open to be answered by other publications.
